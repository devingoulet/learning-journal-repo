**What is markdown?**

Markdown is essentially a text editor that allows you to style text on the web. You can add images, create lists, as well as 
bold and italicize. Simply put, it is regular text with some non-alphabetical characters thrown in like * or #

To make an unordered list you can use an asterisk like so 
* Salmon  
* Cod

You can also create a numbered list with standard numbers

1. Whiskey 
1. Gin
1. Vodka

To upload an image you use the format ![Img description] (url) without the space between the description and url

Quotations can be made with this sign >

Example: Spongebob said:

>i'm ready 

To bold you can use asterisks by applying to of the symbols before and after the word ex. **word** 
or you can italicize by using a single asterisk or under score on both sides of the word ex. *word*
