# Basic Intro of CSS

> * CSS treats each HTMl element as if it appears inside its own box and uses the _rules_ to indicate how that element should look
> * _Rules_ are made up of selectors (these specify the elements of which the rule applies to) and declorations 
> (these indicate what these elements should look like)
> * Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements 
> * Declorations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.
> For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies that Arial is the preffered type.
> * CSS rules usually apear in a seperate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Color

* RGB Values
  > These express color in terms of how much red, green, and blue are used to make it up. The color expression is determined
  > numerically from numbers 0-225. Example: RGB (100,100,90)
 
* Hex Codes
  > These are six digit codes that represent the amount of red, green, and blue in a color preceded by a pound sign. 
  > Example: #ee3e80
  
* Color Names
  > There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. Example: DarkCyan
  
# Contrast 

  > Low contrast is when the the foreground and the background almost blend. Low contrast makes for a difficult read 
  > for those with visual impairments and color blindness.
