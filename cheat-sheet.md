# Cheat Sheet 

*Terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard 
and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it
will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.*

* Opening terminal on a mac: Hit Command+Space, that will bring up spotlight, type "Terminal" and boom you're in.
* Inside terminal you have what's known as a shell. This is a part of the OS that will define how the terminal will look 
and behave after you execute a command. Various shells are available, but the most common is known as **Bash**.

**Paths**

There are two types of paths. Relative and absolute. Whenever you refer to a file or a directory you will be using one of 
these paths. Also, whenever we refer to a file or directory we can use either path.

* Absolute Path Specifies a file or directory in relation to the root directory. 
You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )

* Relative Path Specifies a file or directory in relation to where we currently are in the system. 
They will not begin with a slash.

* Manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics 
of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept.
