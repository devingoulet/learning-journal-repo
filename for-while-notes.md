# For Loops and While Loops

**For Loops**
  > It's the most common loop and it's used for running your code a specific number of times in a for loop there is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.
  
**While Loops**
  > If you don't know how many times to a run a loop a while loop is your best bet. The condition can be something other a counter, and the code will continue to loop as long as the condition is _true_.
  > (key word) -> for (condition counter)-> (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    (code to execute during loop) -> document.write(i);
    }
