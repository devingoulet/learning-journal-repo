Learning Journal 
## Welcome to GitHub Pages


#_Personal Summary_ 
Hey! My name is Devin, I'm 23 years old and a Seattle native. I'm super psyched to learn more about code and take this as far as I can. That being said, I am just now starting my coding journey. It is currently March of 2020 and I have a very long way to go. Stick around for the ride and let's see where this goes.

#_Growth Mindset_
To me a growth mindset is your ability to realize that nothing wrothwhile will come easy and understanding that to overcome your struggles you must become **mentally resilient**

#**Three Reminders to Keep Myself in a Growth Mindset**
1. Understanding that I am new to this and that this is a completely new field for me
2. Knowing that I am not alone when I feel lost and that people are there to help
3. Keeping my time structured and manageable to maximize my learning ability


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/devingoulet/learning-journal-repo/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/devingoulet/learning-journal-repo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
