_Personal Summary_ 

Hey! My name is Devin, I'm 23 years old and a Seattle native. I'm super psyched to learn more about code and take this as far as I can. That being said, I am just now starting my coding journey. It is currently March of 2020 and I have a very long way to go. Stick around for the ride and let's see where this goes.

_Growth Mindset_

To me a growth mindset is your ability to realize that nothing worthwhile will come easy and understanding that to overcome your struggles you must become **mentally resilient**

**Three Reminders to Keep Myself in a Growth Mindset**

1. Understanding that I am new to this and that this is a completely new field for me
2. Knowing that I am not alone when I feel lost and that people are there to help
3. Keeping my time structured and manageable to maximize my learning ability
