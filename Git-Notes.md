# Git Notes

**What is Git?**

Git is a DVSC (Distributed Version Control System) that stores data in a file system that is comprised of snapshots. Everytime you 
make a change to a project (you commit it) git takes a snapshot of that commit for a reference point.

**Local Operations**

Git relies on local ops, becasue most of the neccesary info can be found from local resources. Allowing for project efficiency
because the project resides on a local disk. Which eliminates the need to retrieve history information from the server, 
and allowing you to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.

**States** 

Git resides in three states - Committed, modified, and staged 

    Committed: Data is securely stored in a local database

    Modified: File has been changed but not committed to the database

    Staged: Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
